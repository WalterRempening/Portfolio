          "copy": "To conclude my studies in Human Computer Interaction, I designed and developed a web based activity sculpture configurator. The project lasted for 6 months, in which extensive research about the subject was performed and the configurator was designed, developed and tested. The recollection of personal activity data has been greatly facilitated by the increasing amount of applications and devices that encourage users to measure their activity with the primary goal of health improvement. These devices range from mobile applications taking advantage of smartphone sensors to dedicated fitness trackers presented as modern watches and bracelets. Apart from the analytical insights about the data obtained through classic data visualizations, it is also possible to visualize the information through physical objects also known as activity sculptures. It has been shown that activity sculptures have a positive influence in users, making them feel rewarded for their active lifestyle. To further study the process of visualizing activity information into sculptures, a web-based activity sculpture creator was developed. This tool takes advantage of modern web technologies and offers a platform in which users can import their data, and allows them to experiment by creating variations of an activity sculpture which can also be exported for 3D printing. For the development of the configurator, current product customization platforms were analyzed for gathering best practices in user interface and interaction design. In order for users to have a sculpture with a high degree of data mapping variability, 4 different sculpture prototypes were developed. For the validation of the configurator an online version was released and a user study was performed. User feedback showed that the prototype was easy to operate and that the obtained sculptures were appealing and meaningful to them."

This traduces in users having greater or lesser freedom for manipulating the sculpture.  In order to provide users with a sculpture that is not only appealing but also offers them a high degree of customization, several prototypes were developed. Each sculpture prototype explores different metaphors for visualizing the highest number of activity variables while maintaining an inviting and appealing form that stimulates users to self-reflection and interaction with the sculpture. <br> The activity vase was chosen for further development as it provided great variable representation flexibility and its abstract form was suitable to target a wide range of users."

During the user study a tracking application was used to generate a heat map from click events, presenting the areas most frequently clicked. <br>The user study showed that it seems web configurators are not as common as it was thought, but users are willing to experiment and the customization of products remains interesting for most users. The web configurator performed very well as users found it to be easy to operate and also easy to learn. All controls functioned properly and the labels were also understood by users. Interestingly, users spent more time experimenting with different combinations of variables mapped to the sculpture than customizing the geometry. The activity sculpture was also perceived as aesthetically appealing."

In order to cut the time and work on the testing phase, an OBD simulator device was needed for fast and easy analysis. <br>For my bachelor thesis I designed and developed an android app that provided the data for the Drivedeck application. The setup for using the simulator consisted of a box with two connected OBD dongles. One dongle was paired to a smartphone running the Drivedeck app and the other dongle was paired to another device running the simulator app. The simulator allows developers to setup three different onboard computers with around 200 parameters and change their value in real time. Developers are also able to import csv files and the simulator will read the data from the file and transmit it to the Drivedeck if specific behaviors must be simulated."

The ROLIC cooking top consists of a panel from which the induction top can be rolled out for cooking. The surface of the cooking top is made out of a flexible material composed of several smaller induction heaters. When a pan is placed on top of the surface, the induction heaters detect where the pan is placed and a ring of LED lights will light the pan. Instantly a button will pop out of the panel allowing the user to adjust the heat. After the user has finished cooking he can roll the surface back into the panel, clearing the used space for other purposes."

When a top was placed over these areas the pressure sensor registered the pressure and, if it went over a defined threshold, it activated a LED light animation indicating the user that the top had detected the pan. At the moment of placing the pan on the panel, a servo motor brought a knob up with several LEDs and a potentiometer for dialing the heat.<br> I enjoyed the experience of working in a multidisciplinary team, learning how other people approach problem solving. Besides, getting my hands dirty by soldering and moving away from the screen in general was a refreshing experience."
