These devices range from mobile applications taking advantage of smart- phone sensors to dedicated fitness trackers presented as modern watches and bracelets. Apart from the analytical insights about the data obtained through classic data visualizations, it is also possible to visualize the information through physical objects also known as activity sculptures. It has been shown that activity sculptures have a positive influence in users making them feel re- warded for their active lifestyle. To further study the process of visualizing activity information into sculptures a web-based activity sculpture creator was developed. This tool takes advantage of modern web technologies and offers a platform in which users can import their data and allows them to experiment creating variations of an activity sculpture which can also be exported for 3D printing. For the development of the configurator current product customization platforms were analyzed for gathering best practices in user interface and interaction design. In order for users to have a sculpture with a high degree of data mapping variability, 4 different sculpture prototypes were developed. For the validation of the configurator an online version was released and a user study was performed. User feedback showed that our prototype was easy to operate and that the obtained sculptures were appealing and meaningful to them."
