The project lasted for 6 months in which extensive research about the subject was performed and the configurator was designed, developed and tested. <br><br> The recollection of personal activity data has been greatly facilitated by the increasing amount of applications and devices that encourage users to measure their activity with the primary goal of health improvement. These devices range from mobile applications taking advantage of smartphone sensors to dedicated fitness trackers presented as modern watches and bracelets. Apart from the analytical insights about the data obtained through classic data visualizations, it is also possible to visualize the information through physical objects also known as activity sculptures. It has been shown that activity sculptures have a positive influence in users making them feel rewarded for their active lifestyle. To further study the process of visualizing activity information into sculptures a web-based activity sculpture creator was developed. This tool takes advantage of modern web technologies and offers a platform in which users can import their data and allows them to experiment creating variations of an activity sculpture which can also be exported for 3D printing. For the development of the configurator current product customization platforms were analyzed for gathering best practices in user interface and interaction design. In order for users to have a sculpture with a high degree of data mapping variability, 4 different sculpture prototypes were developed. For the validation of the configurator an online version was released and a user study was performed. User feedback showed that our prototype was easy to operate and that the obtained sculptures were appealing and meaningful to them."

This traduces in users having greater or lesser freedom for manipulating the the sculpture.  In order to provide users with a sculpture that is not only appealing but also offers them a high degree of customization, several prototypes were developed. Each sculpture prototype explores different metaphors for visualizing the highest number of activity variables while maintaining an inviting and appealing form that stimulates users to self reflection and interaction with the sculpture. <br> The activity vase was chosen for further development as it provided great variable representation flexibility and its abstract form was suitable to target a wide range of users."

Through each configurator iteration the configuration process was simplified and the use of certain widgets and controls were questioned and reanalyzed."

The user study was comprised of a thinking aloud usability test with a small group of participants and an online test both including a questionnaire. During the user study a tracking application was used to generate a heat map from click events, presenting the areas clicked frequently. <br>The user study showed that it seems web configurators are not as common as thought, but users are willing to experiment and the customization of products remains interesting for most users. The web configurator performed very well as users found it to be ease to operate and also easy to learn. All controls performed well and the labels were also understood by users. Interestingly users spend more time experimenting with different combinations of variables mapped to the sculpture than customizing the geometry. The activity sculpture was also perceived as aesthetically appealing and users seem to have a neutral opinion towards the level of representation abstraction used in the sculpture."

Working with cutting edge technologies was challenging and rewarding as it really stretched my skills as a developer having to code for a variety of tasks from backend to parametric design functionality. Performing user studies on a platform I ideated was exciting as it allowed me to discover how users interact with concepts that might be logical for me but not for them. Enjoy the renders of the activity sculptures generated by the configurator."

I got the chance to work with a Munich based agency throughout the development process and this proofed to be a very rewarding yet challenging experience as the deadline for delivering the prototype was tight. Technology wise I was more involved in the design and front end side of things but later on I took on the task of expanding the PHP/Symphony app and deploying it to our server.  "
